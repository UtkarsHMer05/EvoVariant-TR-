| 1 | Control plane + ML protocol | PASS | `research/ml_extension/`, control-plane CLI, and contract tests |
| 2 | Canonical scoring repair | BLOCKED | Local repair and validation pass; required real Modal pilot is unavailable because no verified Modal CLI/account authentication or paid-compute acknowledgement is present. See completion record below. |

## Phase 0 completion record — 2026-09-21

- Commit baseline: `a5604eebec449dc95983f7570c483c443aa15bd8`
- Active branch/worktree: `research/evovariant-tr` / `/Users/utkarshkhajuria/Desktop/EvoVariant`
- Commands and results: recorded in `docs/agent/BASELINE_AUDIT.md`; protocol CLI,
  protocol contract, Ruff, mypy, synthetic scientific tests, synthetic API E2E tests, and
  empty-registry verification passed; the repository `make validate` gate and frontend lint/
  build gates remain failed for documented permission/code reasons.
- Frozen protocol SHA-256: `78799000023ca157b72836a0ec603abb20c93960b15fba09485bd0dffbbb1525`
- Handoff manifest: all 18 entries verified by exact path, byte count, and SHA-256 before the
  ZIP was moved to `/private/tmp/EvoVariant_TR_Codex_Handoff.verified.zip`.
- Baseline audit SHA-256: `b5ff51af3eaa840408baf6513715d2cc5abed1bb8587e91d34fe138dfa9634a7`.
- Paid Modal work: not run; estimated and measured Phase 0 spend: `$0`.
- Completed experiments: none; only local deterministic/scientific/API validation tiers ran.
- Remaining risks: active legacy threshold/confidence behavior; fake API scorer; unimplemented
  Evo2 adapter; 8,193-base Modal formula; schema/identity drift; absent raw archives; empty
  registry; and local validation/frontend gate failures. See the audit for exact evidence.
- Gate decision: PASS for diagnostic documentation only. Do not begin model download, training,
  HPO, fine-tuning, locked evaluation, or paid Modal work. Phase 1 remains pending and is not
  started in this turn.

## Phase 1 completion record — 2026-09-21

- Implementation commit: `1f777b5`; no source model or paid compute work was run.
- Control-plane files: `research/ml_extension/protocol.yaml`, `split_policy.yaml`, and
  `protocol_hashes.json`.
- Schemas: `model_manifest.schema.json`, `split_manifest.schema.json`,
  `experiment_config.schema.json`, and `cost_ledger.schema.json`.
- Commands: `python3.12 -m evovariant_tr.cli validate-ml-control-plane --repo-root .` passed;
  targeted contract tests passed (`8 passed` including the frozen protocol contract), Ruff and
  strict mypy passed (`35 source files`).
- Original protocol SHA-256 remained
  `78799000023ca157b72836a0ec603abb20c93960b15fba09485bd0dffbbb1525`.
- Extension protocol SHA-256:
  `374bc2c59941d6001e41c478658ad65fa4e2ae0789829d2625e8801b00ad7c5c`.
- Decisions added: D-012 through D-017 covering separation, schemas, model feasibility,
  cache identity, validation-only selection, adaptation gating, and out-of-fold stacking.
- Spend: `$0`; no model weights, locked labels, or Modal resources used.
- Gate decision: PASS for the control-plane phase. Phase 2 may begin; Phase 3 and later remain
  dependent on repaired scoring and verified data/control artifacts.

## Phase 2 completion record — 2026-09-21

- Implementation: canonical scoring, API/proxy, Modal adapter, and research-workbench UI
  repairs are in the Phase 2 implementation checkpoint; the source commit is recorded in
  the next ledger update after the working tree is committed.
- Contract changes: exact 8,192-base windows; coordinate/allele/SNV/orientation invariants;
  forward and reverse-complement raw components; explicit primary-delta and disagreement
  fields; canonical GRCh38 payload aliases; fail-closed unconfigured services; no fake
  production scorer; and no threshold/confidence/clinical classification in the research UI.
- Validation commands and results:
  - `make validate` — PASS: secret scan, Ruff, strict mypy (36 source files), `567 passed,
    33 deselected, 1 warning`, and `95.17%` coverage.
  - `make protocol-verify` — PASS.
  - `make registry-verify` — PASS.
  - `make ml-protocol-verify` — PASS.
  - Scientific tests — `7 passed, 1 skipped`.
  - E2E tests — `14 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning`.
  - Frontend legacy-classification scan — PASS; no `prediction`, threshold, confidence, or
    pathogenic/benign classification logic remains in `apps/web/src`.
  - `git diff --check` — PASS.
- Frozen original protocol SHA-256 remains
  `78799000023ca157b72836a0ec603abb20c93960b15fba09485bd0dffbbb1525`.
- Spend: `$0`; no model weights, locked labels, Modal deployment, or GPU call was run.
- Blocking evidence: a real Modal pilot is an explicit Phase 2 gate, but this environment has
  no verified Modal CLI/account authentication and no user-provided paid-compute
  acknowledgement. Local/fake tests cannot substitute for that gate.
- Gate decision: `BLOCKED` for the complete Phase 2 gate. Phase 3 data/split work may proceed
  independently because it is controlled by the frozen protocol and does not require a paid
  Modal run. Phase 4 compute work remains gated.
